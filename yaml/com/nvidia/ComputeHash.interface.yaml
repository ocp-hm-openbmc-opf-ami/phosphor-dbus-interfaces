   Implement to provide hash computation of firmware for non-pldm devices.
properties:
    - name: Digest
      type: string
      description: >
           This property shall contain the digest of this firmware using the
           hash algorithm indicated by Algorithm property.

          - readonly
    - name: Algorithm
      type: string
      description: >
           This property shall contain the hash algorithm used to compute the
           digest of this firmware.
      flags:

methods:
    - name: GetHash
      description: >
        This method shall compute the digest of this firmware using a hash
        algorithm specified in Algorithm property. Once hash compute is
        done Digest property will be updated with the hash value.
      parameters:
          - name: DeviceId
            type: uint16
            description: >
                Device Id for which hash needs to be computed. For example
                retimer Id.
