    PackageInformation interface provides information about firmware package
    properties such as package version, package verification status.
    To provide other package properties, applications which implements this
    interface are also expected to implement EpochTime interface for timestamp,
    ComputeHash interface for package digest information. Additionally
    implement Delete Interface to remove the firmware package and clear
    firmware package information properties.

properties:
    - name: PackageVersion
      type: string
      description: >
          Package version of firmware package. This value should be read from
          package metadata.
    - name: VerificationStatus
      type: enum[self.PackageVerificationStatus]
      description: >
          Verification status of firmware package. Should indicate verification
          status of the package by validating package metadata, signature
          verification etc.
