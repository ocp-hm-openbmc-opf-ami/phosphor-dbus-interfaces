    Implement this interface for clients to configure the firmware update
    policy. The properties override the default policy of the firmware package
    and is applied during firmware update. The properties are modified only by
    the client and firmware update has no side effect on the properties. If the
    policy is no longer applicable, the client is expected to reset the policy
    to the defaults.

properties:
    - name: Targets
      type: array[object_path]
      description: >
          An array of D-Bus object paths that are in the
          /xyz/openbmc_project/software/ namespace that indicate the firmware
          targets to be updated. The targets for firmware update will be the
          intersection of the Targets property and the firmware inventory
          the package is intended to update. If the Targets property is empty,
          the targets intended to be updated by package will be updated.

    - name: ForceUpdate
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: >
          If ForceUpdate is set to true, it is a request to the implementer to
          bypass update policies, such as allowing a component be downgraded.
          If ForceUpdate is set to false, the implementer will proceed with the
          default policies of the system or the firmware package. ForceUpdate
          policy applies for all the targets to be updated.
