    Implement to provide aggregated metrics for all sensors.
properties:
    - name: SensorMetrics
      type: dict[string, struct[variant[string, int32, int16, int64, uint16, uint32, uint64, double, boolean], uint64, object_path]]
      description: >
          A map that stores mapping from sensor name to its value,
          chassis path and timestamp when the sensor reading got refreshed
    - name: StaleSensorUpperLimitms
      type: uint32
      description: >
          Time interval in miliseconds to calculate the staleness of a sensor. This metric 
          will be common to all the sensor for a given platform
